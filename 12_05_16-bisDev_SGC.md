### Useful events
These were 
* speed pitching
* hipsters, hackers, hustlers

We should offer more talks, Dan will be working on speaking decks we should get a list of 3 or 4 talks we should give


### Invest time in open source projects
Perhaps have a week of trying to create libraries which will show our caliber of our code quality and we will also raise our profile in the community. It will be a good opportunity to work on writing good quality code, writing npm modules would be a good way to do this.

The Anna Freud projects will now incorporate some people taking time out and creating libraries which people working on the project can use, perhaps in the form of an npm module.


### Dev ops conference
We should be going to more tech and charity conferences. We should take this opportunity despite feeling that the event is too high caliber.


### List of potential talk titles
We need to get a list of potential talk titles and we need to find good meet ups where we can go and deliver them.


We should make sure 3 or so people go to everything on the meet up rota, we need to formulate how to measure the quality of the meet ups. Also, our data collection for this is dismal.


### 3rd sector meet-ups
These are good, but need to be more spread out. It’s a good source of income and a way for us to network with non technical people. We should encourage fac8 to go along and we should also try to be available to go along.


### Saturday
People will be joining Dan on Saturday, Tom said he would be available and perhaps Owen


### Personal business cards
Will happen when we develop our separate logo and identity


### What is our product
Dan will get back to us for what he think our product is


### Our meet up
It was time well spent, only 30 mins of admin before was sufficient for organising the event. We could reward the winner with having fac8 working on the winning project. We should send unfunded clients to our pitch events.
We should charge people £5 to pitch to filter out the those with naff ideas. We should charge for our sales effort.
It will help with building up our brand.
